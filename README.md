Codegorilla lesson: Developing a PHP framework

This is just a basic PHP MVC framework to practice classes and learn coding when using Composer with autoload.

# Installation
- cd ~/
- cd /your-sites-folder/php-practice

- npm install
- composer install

- touch .env
- go to your code editor (Visual Studio Code etc.)
- open .env file and add: APP_NAME="My App"

Thats it ;-)
